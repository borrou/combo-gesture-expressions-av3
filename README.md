# ComboGestureExpressions for Avatars 3.0

### [> Download latest version...](https://github.com/hai-vr/combo-gesture-expressions-av3/releases)

*ComboGestureExpressions* is an Unity Editor tool that lets you attach face expressions to hand gestures, and automatically generate an *Avatars 3.0* animator to match these gestures.

Using this tool:

- Face expressions are fully predictable when combining different gestures.
  This resolves an issue with classic avatars where two face expressions would conflict and mess with the appearance of the eyes.
- Eyes will no longer blink whenever the avatar has a face expression with eyes closed.
- Multiple face expressions can be bound to a single gesture, using the expressions menu to switch between sets of face expressions.
- Enjoy the new Avatars 3.0 finer face expression controls alongside the classic gesture face expression controls.

This tool should NOT be used for:

- ‚ùå Animating hand and finger positions.
  To animate hand and finger positions, use the Avatars 3.0's Gesture layer which is made for this purpose.
